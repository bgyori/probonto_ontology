ProbOnto.owl version 1.1.5 merged

To be cloned into 2.0.0

Additions: 
- added new instances of Probability Distributions
- added HF and SF together with relevant informations
- added a number of additional labels for distributions with alternative names

Change to namespace and ID conventions: 
- This release of ProbOnto has a single namespace: http://www.probonto.org/ontology for entities derived from http://www.probonto.org/core and http://www.probonto.org/kb
- IDs are formatted as follows: 
PROB_[c|k]nnnnnnn
where "c" is used for core entities and "k" is used for knowledge base entities. The numerical part retains the 7 digit format. 

http://www.probonto.org/core#0000020 is equivalent to http://www.probonto.org/ontology#PROB_c0000020

http://www.probonto.org/kb#0000020 is equivalent to http://www.probonto.org/ontology#PROB_k0000020

No formal mapping is provided between versions. 

Backward compatibility through mapping: unverified
