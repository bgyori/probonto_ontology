Additions and modifications: 
- Additional PDs
- Change in relationship classification. Internally called 'delta' version whereby composition gives way to 'stronger' component. E.g., 'reparameterisation' for 'reparameterisation, limiting'. This is a content, reversible change. 

Namespace and ID conventions: Unchanged from corresponding 2.0
- This release of ProbOnto has a single namespace: http://www.probonto.org/ontology for entities derived from http://www.probonto.org/core and http://www.probonto.org/kb
- IDs are formatted as follows: 
PROB_[c|k]nnnnnnn
where "c" is used for core entities and "k" is used for knowledge base entities. The numerical part retains the 7 digit format.
